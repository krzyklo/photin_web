The company aim is to provide dedicated, fast and flexible MOCVD wafer
growth services to worldwide customers in R&D and small scale production
of compound semiconductor devices (InP / GaAs/ GaSb/ InAs ).  
<br>  
As **“Pure Play” MOCVD fab** we offer customers affordable development
of epitaxial layers stacks on 2” substrates of choice (working on 3”
capabilities) and full information on technology of growth processes and
related data characterization.  
<br>  
The information shared include:  
- full data logs of Aixtron reactors (process temperatures, pressures,
flows etc.)  
- full logs of MO lines equipped with ultrasonic in-situ gas delivery
sensors (exact info on reagent flow to reactor)  
- full in situ monitoring data from LayTec EpiRAS or EpiCurve (true
wafer temperature, RAS, reflectance or curvature), which provide unique
fingerprint of process grown,  
- standard characterization data: HR XRD, 300K PL, Hall, ECV,  
- other relevant characterization data, are additionally offered on case
by case basis (SIMS, SEM, TEM, AFM).

<br>  
We do support our customers in technology transfer of developed process
or device structure to large foundries or companies, that could offer
benefits of large scale manufacturing and cost reduction out of reach
for SME.  
<br>  
If needed we are happy to support customers also in area of device
simulation and epitaxial design of lasers, LEDs, detectors, and solar
cells (in house or via large network of specialists we have cooperate
with).  
<br>  
Over the years, we have been working with/for AMS Sensors, AMS-OSRAM,
Modulight, DenseLight, POET Technologies, VIGO System/Photonics, Brolis,
Ensemble3, Bright Photonics, Huawei, Lancaster University, Institute of
Microelectronics and Photonics (Poland), Military University of
Technology (Poland).
