*The first* commercial apparatus produced by AIXTRON company in mid
80-ies, sold to AEG Telefunken, then Messerschmidt and afterwards
donated to FZU in 1994. After a reconstruction the apparatus was used
for research and development of arsenide and antimonide heterostructures
in FZU for 25 years.

Seven precursor lines enter the mixing manifold with circular symmetry.
2 lines are dedicated for metalorganic group III precursors, 2 lines for
group V precursors and 2 lines for dilution 1 hydrogen line for
adjustment of the total flow through the reactor.

The quartz reactor with liner has horizontal construction with optical
port enabling in situ monitoring of the epitaxial process. SiC coated
grafite susceptor is heated up to 850°C by radio frequency coil
surrounding reactor tube.

Impartible components of the equipment are also three thermostatic baths
for precursors and LayTec EpiRAS system for in situ monitoring of
epitaxial process by Reflectance Anisotropy Spectroscopy (RAS). The
method is suitable only for epitaxy of cubic crystals.

All Photin reactors are based on VME technology known for ruggedness and
reliability.
