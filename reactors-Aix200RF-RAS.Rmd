*The first* commercial apparatus produced by AIXTRON company in mid 80-ies, sold to AEG Telefunken,
then Messerschmidt and afterwards donated to FZU in 1994. After a reconstruction the apparatus was
used for research and development of arsenide and antimonide heterostructures in FZU for 25 years.    

Seven precursor lines enter the mixing manifold with circular symmetry. 2 lines are dedicated for
metalorganic group III precursors, 2 lines for group V precursors and 2 lines for dilution 1 hydrogen line for adjustment of the total flow through the reactor.  

The quartz reactor with liner has horizontal construction with optical port enabling in situ  monitoring of the epitaxial process. SiC coated grafite susceptor is heated up to 850°C by radio frequency coil surrounding reactor tube.

Impartible components of the equipment are also three thermostatic baths for precursors and LayTec EpiRAS system for in situ monitoring of epitaxial process by Reflectance Anisotropy Spectroscopy (RAS). The method is suitable only for epitaxy of cubic crystals.
