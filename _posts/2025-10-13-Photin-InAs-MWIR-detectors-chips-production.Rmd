What was some time ago only distant dream, today it is reality in our hands. Production batch of MWIR InAs/InAsSbP 500um diameter detector chips, ready to be delivered to first customers. Made in Poland by Photin and MUT.  

What they will do? As usual for compound semiconductor devices, making impossible possible.. sense what unseen..  
Perhaps this chips will be measuring in microseconds temperature in industrial process, sense gases, or read out laser waveforms in open space communication..   
Tiny chips, which makes big machines work safely, and in control.  

**Those chips are now available for purchase.**  
As our focus is on growth of wafers, and our partner MUT is not interested in production, we consider this chips a temporary product, which is predominantly dedicated to customers interested in growth of wafers, who are looking for proof-of-wafer-quality information.  
If anyone is interested, we gather inquiries on what type of package is required: eg. SMD, TO-46, TO-18.  
Rather no plan to package chips with TEC for 230-210K operation, as this would require much more effort on our side.  

Usually, there are MOQ of 10 (Minimum Order Quantity) for such chips / detectors.  
Roithner PriceList spreadsheet is good point of reference (recently MOQ was removed):    

**98.05 EUR**       **PD36-05SMD3020**,  
1.8-3.8 µm, 0.5 mm, 1.0-1.2 A/W, 300-1000 µA, SMD 3.0x2.0 mm  

**118.4 EUR**       **PD36-05**,  
1.8-3.8 µm, 0.5 mm, 1.0-1.2 A/W, 300-1000 µA, TO-18

```{r hist01, out.width="99%", fig.cap='Scatter plot of Rshunt of chips.', fig.show='hold', echo=F, message = F, warning=F}
load("../assets/img/251013_InAs_production/chips.Rds")

pp=chips %>% #filter(x>10) 
    ggplot(aes(cid,Rd)) + geom_point() + scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(n.dodge = 2)) +
    xlab("Chip ID") + ylab("R shunt, Ohm")

knitr::include_graphics("../assets/img/251013_InAs_production/xy.png")

```


```{r hist02, out.width="99%", fig.cap='Histogram plot of Rshunt of chips.', fig.show='hold', echo=F, message = F, warning=F}

# hist(chips$Rd, breaks = c(seq(0,1400,200)), main="Histogram of Rshunt", sub="After 1 month from processing", xlab="Rshunt ranges, Ohm", ylab="Counts, pcs")

#dev.print(file="../assets/img/251013_InAs_production/hist.png", device=png, width=800)

knitr::include_graphics("../assets/img/251013_InAs_production/hist.png")

```


### Pricing

We plan to price InAs detectors by Rshunt, and without MOQ:  

1. below 250 Ohm, 100 EUR.  
2. 250-500 Ohm, 150 EUR  
3. 500-750 Ohm, 175 EUR  
4. 750-1200 Ohm 200 EUR.  

At that moment we would like to sell chips with ID C1..C10 range. The chips A1-A10 are sold. Other chips are for now kept for future.  

```{r chips01, out.width="99%", fig.show='hold', echo=F, message = F, warning=F}

# hist(chips$Rd, breaks = c(seq(0,1400,200)), main="Histogram of Rshunt", sub="After 1 month from processing", xlab="Rshunt ranges, Ohm", ylab="Counts, pcs")

#dev.print(file="../assets/img/251013_InAs_production/hist.png", device=png, width=800)
