Photin acquired the first commercial Aixtron Aix-200RF reactor, superbly
rebuilt and maintained by Czech Academy of Sciences team.

This purchase finalize phase of investments into MOCVD capabilities for
Photin.  
With fleet of 3x Aix-200 reactors, complemented by planetary Aix 2400
G1, Photin offer customers perfect environment for R&D and small scale
production.

Acquired FZU reactor is equipped in state of the art in-situ Reflectance
Anisotropy Spectroscopy (EpiRAS TT made by LayTec), the most powerful
diagnostic technique available in MOCVD technology. It allows in situ
measurements of growth rate and surface smoothness, but is also
sensitive to surface reconstruction of layer’s atomic planes.  
This is ultimate tool for in situ optimization of MOCVD gas switching
sequences and could provide information about doping of layers in
\~1e17-1e19cm-3 range. Transfer of the reactor to Photin HQ is planned
for end of May 2022.

**Would like to thank FZU team: Alice, Jiri and Karel, who kept
operational and upgraded this marvelous piece of technology for all this
years.**  
This is prime example, that optoelectronics leap forward, but physics do
not change. Also it is showcase how well Aixtron machines are made.

**Inquiries for growth of 2” wafers on GaSb, GaAs, and InP could be sent
to kk{sign}photin.eu.**
