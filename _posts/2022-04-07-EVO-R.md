Photin complete [EIT Manufacturing
EVO-R](https://eit.europa.eu/our-activities/opportunities/eit-manufacturing-open-ris-call-evo-r)
project dedicated to purchase, transfer, and set-up of Aixtron Aix-200RF
MOCVD reactor from Ulm University to Photin facility.

This is 3rd reactor purchase for Photin. Acquisition of such well
maintained, fully documented, and operational reactor resulted in
synergy effects and rapid acceleration of works on Aixtron Aix-200/4 and
Aixtron Aix 2400 G1 reactors standing in Photin facility. All Photin
reactors are based on VME technology known for ruggedness and
reliability.

The Aix-200RF reactor was operational 1 week after transfer, and
extensively tested on provisional water cooling and nitrogen supply.
Facility works are in progress with outlook to grow first wafers in Q2
of 2022.

**Inquiries for growth of 2” wafers on GaSb, GaAs, and InP could be sent
to <kk@photin.eu>.**

*Would like to acknowledge and express gratitude to prof. Ferdinand
Scholz and his PhD students, who for decades worked on upgrades and
maintenance of this reactor.*
