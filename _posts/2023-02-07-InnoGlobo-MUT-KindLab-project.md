### Intro

One of the best paths for survival of deep-techs, is non-dilutive
financing via EU and national grants.  
Photin is exploring this path for \~1 year. Recently, we had deepened
our cooperation with [Military University of
Technology](https://www.wtc.wat.edu.pl/) and [K.I.N.D.
Lab](https://ece.osu.edu/krishna-infrared-detector-k.i.n.d.-laboratory),
which manifested in application for [InnoGlobo
2](https://www.gov.pl/web/ncbr/ii-konkurs-w-ramach-programu-innoglobo)
in 2022.  
The project is focused on low temperature IR detector passivation using
MOCVD technology.

### Passivation challenges

Despite perfect passivation results shown usually in publication, the
true processing results are not so ideal, and there are process
variations.  
Even for apparently mature InP/InGaAs detectors technology, passivation
of small pixels is challenging
(<https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2020.2987006>).

Passivation of antimonides is even more challenging than InGaAs/InP.

### List of InnoGlobo2 applications

![](/../assets/img/230107_InnoGlobo2/lista.png)<!-- -->

We proudly announce, that our “PfBaAIRD” project passed formal criteria
and is one of 16 projects selected for next stage review.

Assuming all applicants aimed for maximum \~1.5M, then \~7 of 16
consortiums will receive grant. 42% is one of the highest chances one
could have in grant applications.  
We keep our thumbs!
