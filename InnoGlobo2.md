### Project description:

The project includes industrial and development research. Its main goal
is to develop passivation layers for AIIIBV materials, including
Al-containing layers, limiting leakage currents in barrier (WAT/Photin)
and avalanche (KINDLab) structures. The passivation layers developed as
part of the project will increase the performance of the analyzed
detection devices compared to the parameters currently obtained. The end
result of the proposed 3-year project will be nBn and APD detection
structures developed in terms of passivation (limiting surface
currents), which will be offered by PHOTIN (Poland) and SK Infrared
(USA), respectively.

The research topic undertaken results from the fact that bulk materials
and, recently, type II superlattices InAs/InAsSb, are used in the
production of simple nBn barrier detectors operating in the medium and
long-wavelength range, as well as avalanche photodiodes for the
short-wavelength range. The factor limiting the performance of the
above-mentioned detectors are surface defects common to AIIIBV
materials. To our knowledge, no uniform, repeatable and effective
passivation layers limiting leakage currents have been developed so far.

On the part of the Military University of Technology, the research work
will be led by Col. Prof. Ph.D. engineer Piotr Martyniuk, while Photin
will be represented by: Dr. Eng. Krzysztof Kłos, and the American side
is prof. Sanjay Krishna.
