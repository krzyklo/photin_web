Aixtron Aix-200 RF reactor acquired from Ulm University in the [EIT
Manufacturing
EVO-R](https://eit.europa.eu/our-activities/opportunities/eit-manufacturing-open-ris-call-evo-r)
project dedicated to purchase, transfer, and set-up of reactor from Ulm
University to Photin facility.

This is 3rd reactor purchase for Photin. Acquisition of such well
maintained, fully documented, and operational reactor resulted in
synergy effects and rapid acceleration of works on Aixtron Aix-200/4 and
Aixtron Aix 2400 G1 reactors standing in Photin facility.

All Photin reactors are based on VME technology known for ruggedness and
reliability.

The Aix-200RF reactor was operational 1 week after transfer, and
extensively tested on provisional water cooling and nitrogen supply.

Facility works were completed in Apr 2022.

**This reactor is now used for project focused on development of
InGaAsSb barrier detectors.**

**Inquiries for growth of 2” wafers on GaSb, GaAs, and InP could be sent
to kk{sign}photin.eu.**
